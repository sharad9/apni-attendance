          A GPS tracking unit,
           geotracking unit, satellite tracking unit, or simply tracker is a navigation device
          normally on a vehicle, asset, person or animal that uses satellite navigation to determine its movement and
          determine its WGS84 UTM geographic position (geotracking) to determine its location.[1] Satellite tracking
          devices send special satellite signals that are processed by a receiver.

          Locations are stored in the tracking unit or transmitted to an Internet-connected device using the cellular
          network (GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE or SMS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit or WiFi work worldwide.

          GPS antenna size limits tracker size, often smaller than a half-dollar (diameter 30.61 mm). In 2020 tracking
          is a $2 billion business plus military-in the gulf war 10% or more targets used trackers. Virtually every
          cellphone tracks its movements. Tracks can be map displayed in real time, using GPS tracking software and
          devices with GPS capability.[2]

          Face Recognition AI Based

             A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a
             video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification
             services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.[1]

             Development began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application. Since their
             inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other
             forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of
             a human's physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although
             the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and
             fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process.[2] Facial recognition systems
             have been deployed in advanced humanâ€“computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of
             images.[3]

             Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies.[4]
             Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their
             ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the
             systems violate citizens' privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and
             racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as
             deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security.[5] These claims have led to the ban of facial
             recognition systems in several cities in the United States.[6] As a result of growing societal concerns,
             Meta announced[7] that it plans to shut down Facebook facial recognition system, deleting the face scan
             data of more than one billion users.[8] This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial
             recognition usage in the technology's history.</pre>
